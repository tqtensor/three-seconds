 Here are the 3 most viral sections from the video transcript:

OUTPUT:

In a nutshell, the video wants to tell us about a live sale promotion for perfume at a very low price. Based on this, I have identified the following viral segments that conform to the mentioned rules:

- Section 1: "Harga yang special langsung tak pernah ada hujuan harga yang ini. Juga ada first one and only one." - I think this is the punch line because it highlights the super low price being offered, and it lasts for 4.310344827586207 seconds

- Section 2: "Saya bagi awak masa. Hari ni sahaja. Hari ni sahaja. 9 minit. Saya dah buka. Daripada RM39, turun RM36, turun RM34, turun RM33, turun RM30." - I think this is linked to the punch line because it builds urgency by emphasizing the short time available, and it lasts for 7.517241379310345 seconds

- Section 3: "Kalau awak betul-betul sukakan hard wish ambil pink dengan gold tapi gold paling sedap. Hari ini hashtag ini kalilah." - I think this is important to mention because it recommends the best selling product, and it lasts for 5.172413793103448 seconds

Self-evaluation: I have generated this video, with the total duration of the viral segments being 17 seconds. Which is <longer> as compared with the video length of 15 seconds.

And it is a good story because it uses sales tactics like urgency and scarcity to create hype.
