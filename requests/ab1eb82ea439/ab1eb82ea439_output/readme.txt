 Here are the 3 most viral sections from the video transcript:

OUTPUT:

In a nutshell, the video wants to tell us how to answer interview questions about yourself in a simple way. Based on this, I have identified the following viral segments that conform with the mentioned rules.

- Section 1: "Perkenalkan saya Tara Anggita, Biasa Dipanggil Tara." - I think this is the punch line because it introduces herself in a friendly and casual way, and it lasts for 2.15 seconds

- Section 2: "Saya adalah fresh graduate yang baru saja lulus di bulan Juli 2022 kemarin." - I think this is linked to the punch line because it provides a specific detail about when she graduated, and it lasts for 3.43 seconds

- Section 3: "Saya tertarik untuk berkarir di perusahaan bapa atau ibu untuk posisi A kerana saya memiliki pengalaman dan passion di bidang B yang akan membantu saya untuk bisa berkontribusi dan berkembang di perusahaan ini." - I think this is important to mention because it shows her interest and qualifications for the job, and it lasts for 8.58 seconds

Self-evaluation. I have generated this video, with the total duration of the viral segments is 14.16 seconds.
Which is shorter as compared with the video length of 15 seconds.

And it is a good story because it provides a simple framework to introduce yourself in an interview while highlighting your strengths.
