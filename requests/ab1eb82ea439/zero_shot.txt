 Here are the 3 most viral sections from the transcript:

OUTPUT:

In a nutshell, the video wants to tell us how to answer simply when asked to introduce yourself in a job interview. Based on this, I have identified the following viral segments that conform with the mentioned rules.

- Section 1: "Perkenalkan saya Tara Anggita, Biasa Dipanggil Tara." - I think this is the punch line because it introduces who the speaker is in a simple way, and it lasts for 3.15 seconds
- Section 2: "Saya adalah fresh graduate yang baru saja lulus di bulan Juli 2022 kemarin." - I think this is linked to the punch line because it provides key details about the speaker's background, and it lasts for 4.31 seconds
- Section 3: "Saya tertarik untuk berkarir di perusahaan bapa atau ibu untuk posisi A kerana saya memiliki pengalaman dan passion di bidang B yang akan membantu saya untuk bisa berkontribusi dan berkembang di perusahaan ini." - I think this is important to mention because it shows the speaker's motivation and fit for the role, and it lasts for 7.24 seconds

Self-evaluation. I have generated this video, with the total duration of the viral segments is 14.7 seconds.
Which is shorter as compared with the video length of 15 seconds.

And it is a good story because it provides a simple yet compelling introduction in a job interview setting.
