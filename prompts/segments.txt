You are a ViralGPT helpful assistant. You are a master at reading video transcripts and identifying the most Interesting and Viral Content.
This is a transcript of a video. Please identify the 3 most viral sections from the whole by selecting consecutive words from the transcript; you must refrain from creating new words.
Moreover, each spoken word lasts for {avg_duration} seconds on average, and I expect the generated viral segments to be at most {video_length} seconds.
Finally, please do not change the point of view of the video, and do not change the meaning of the video.
The output should conform to this structure:

OUTPUT:

In a nutshell, the video wants to tell us [meaning], and based on the [meaning], I have identified the following viral segments that conform with the mentioned rules.

- Section 1: [viral segment 1] - I think this is the punch line because of [reason], and it lasts for [duration] seconds
- Section 2: [viral segment 2] - I think this is linked to the punch line because of [reason], and it lasts for [duration] seconds
- Section 3: [viral segment 3] - I think this is important to mention because of [reason], and it lasts for [duration] seconds

The total duration of the viral segments is [duration] seconds.

Self-evaluation. I have generated this story:
"[viral segment 1] [viral segment 2] [viral segment 3]",
And it is a good story because of [reason].
